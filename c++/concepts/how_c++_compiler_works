----------- Important C++ knowledge from The Cherno (Yan Chernikov)----

---- C++ : How compiler works --------

1. #include, #define,#if-#endif -- all these preprocessors just copy the target file and paste inside the current .cpp file 

2. Abstract Syntax Tree 

3. Constant Folding -- runtime value comparison

4. header files themselves do not get compiled

5. Compilation --> preprocess --> .obj ---> linker ---> execuatble

6. C++ has nothing to do with Files; this is in contrast with JAVA where class names have to be tied with filenames

7. And thus the compiler treats every .cpp file as a translation unit that results in an object file first during compilation

8. In Debug mode of compilation the compiler does not use any optimization but in Release mode it does
