---------- The Cherno : C++ Debugging -------------------

1. In Visual Studio, Debug-->Memory View we can see the memory map, where the uninitialized variable will show 0Xcccccccc (hex). It means Uninitialized Stack Memory.

Now this is specifically done in debug setting, not in th release setting of the compiler for us to figure out what really is wrongin case of an error 

2. Provide &<variable name>, and in the memory map you will see where in the memory the variable is located and what it's current value is (lowest byte first order)
