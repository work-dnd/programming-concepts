============== The Cherno : String Literals ===========

- char* name = "Cherno";
this is const and can't be modified as 
name[2 ] = 'a'; ---XXXX

-- in debug mode --> write access violation error
-- in release mode --  will be compiled, but won't modify it as second line of code will be removed


- in order to modify, declare it as a char array-->
char name[] = "cherno";
now, name[2] = 'a'; --- POSSIBLE

- different types of string types
--- const wchar_t* name = L"Cherno";  ### that L prefix indicates compiler it is wide char
--- here compiler would decide if each of the wide character would be off 2 bytes or 4 bytes

--- to make sure each char is of 2 bytes
const char16_t* name = u"Cherno";

--- for each char to be of 4 bytes
const char32_t* name = U"Cherno";


--- String literals -- TO be contd. from the video
-- string literals are ALWAYS stored in READ-ONLY memory
