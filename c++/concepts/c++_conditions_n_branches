--------- The Cherno : If-else ---------------

1. Use breakpoint --> right click ---> go to disassemby to check assembly codes (this is in debug mode, in release mode, however, compiler can change codes for optimization so be careful)

2. if(x) --> this checks if x not equals to zero

3. In C++, else if is no keyword. It is basically 
if()
{} 
else {
if{}
} --> Just combined together
