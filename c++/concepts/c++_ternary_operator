============== The Cherno : Ternery Operator (? :) ==========

- used instead of if-else

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

    static int s_level = 5;
    static int speed = 10;

int main()
{
    
    //let's say
    if(s_level < 5)
    	speed = 6;
    else
    	speed = 10;
    	
    //instead we can write using ternery operator
    speed = s_level < 5 ? 6 : 10;
    
    // but even better example 
    std::string rank = s_level > 10 : "Master" : "Beginner";
    
    // here we did not have to create any temporary intermediate string for the rank, there is something called return value optimization (future video)
    // had we not used ternary operator
    
    std::string rank; //temporary string creation first
    if(s_level > 10)
    	rank = "Master"; // then updating based on condition ---> slower code 
    else
    	rank = "Beginner";
} 

-- nesting of ternery operator is possible --- but better to AVOID

int speed = s_level >5 && s_level < 100 ? s_level > 10 ? 15 : 10 : 5;
