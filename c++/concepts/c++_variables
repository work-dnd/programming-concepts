----- The Cherno : C++ Variables ---

1. The size of datatype depends upon the compiler, i.e. int would be 32 bit if it's 32 bit compiler

2. Integer range is -2 billion to +2 billion --> out of 32 bits (4 bytes), since it is signed number, ne bit is occupied for sign indication, rest 31 bits are of data (0/1) so -2^31(negatives) to +2^31(positives) - 1 (this one is for storing zero only) 

3. If unsigned int, then compiler can access 32 bits for the unsigned no as thus the range goes from 0 - 2 * 2 billion(2^64)

4. Types of int : (signed/unsigned) char(1B), short(2B), int(4B), long(8B), long long (8B) etc

5. Bool (1B), Char (1B)

6. For bools, 8 bits are used because there is no way to access a single bit for true/false (accessing registers). But there is another way to store 8 different bits in one variable and access them. 

7. Use sizeof(variable) to actually check the size of the datatype
