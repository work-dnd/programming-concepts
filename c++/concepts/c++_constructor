=========== The Cherno: Constructor ===============

- Constructors are special methods of a class that are called every time the class is initialized

- Constructors are used to initialize data members

- Member initialization list 

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

class Entity{
private:
    std::string m_Name;
    int score;
    
public:
    Entity
        :  m_Name("Unknown"), m_score(0) {};
};

- Important : the members are to initialized in the same order as they are declared (in this case string first and then int)

- Why to use member initialization always??
There is indeed a functional difference of not creating multiple instances where each one will overwrite the previous one thereby wasting performance. (example is elaborated in the video as well as in member_initalizer_in_constuctor doc here)
