=========The Cherno : Enum ==========

- Enum is an INTEGER that can be a bunch of variables grouped together, holding some value. 

- If no value is specified for the variables, then by default, enum is a 32-bit integer depending on the compiler and the 1st varibale takes the value to be 0, and rest will be incremented by 1. E.g.

enum Example
{
   A, B, C
};

which means A=0,B=1,C=2

- However, if values are given, then

enum Example
{
 A =5, B= 2, C=7
};

- If 1st value is declared, rest will be incremented by 1 

- If some integer type is to be imposed,

enum Example : unsigned char  (# unsigned char is 8 bit (for less memory) so a valid enum 
type, REMEMEBER : enum is an INTEGER only, cant be float or double )
{ 
   A, B, C
};


usage in main


int main(){

Example value = B;

std::cin.get();
}


- Also, if now value can't be assigned to any other random variable apart from the valid ones from enum Example.

- With enum codes are pretty readable

-Think of Logging states in a log class - error, warning, info ---These can be perfect candidates for enum which by default will have constant states 0, 1, and 2 


class Log{

public:
enum Level : unsigned char
{
  LevelError = 0, LevelWarning, LevelInfo

};

private:

  Level m_LogLevel = LevelInfo;
  
  
public:
   void setLevel(Level level){
   
   	m_logLevel = level;
   } 
};

int main(){

    Log log;
    log.setLevel(Log::LevelError);

}
