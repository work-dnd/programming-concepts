============== The Cherno : C++ New Keyword ============

- new is an operator 

- new returns a pointer to the memory address it has allocated ON THE HEAP for the target datatype

- There is a free list in C++ which has the information about all the free bytes of memory. The new operator has access to that list and 
finds contiguous blocks of memory it has to allocate

- for integer --> int* b = new int; // 4 bytes
- for array --> int* b = new int[5]; // 20 bytes

- for string --> 

- for class (let's say Entity is the class) --> Entity* e = new Entity; // for single allocation of the class whatever the memory is required
- for class array --> Entity* e = new Entity[5]; // 5 contiguous blocks of Entity class will be allocated

**** Important :  In the background new is nothing but calling malloc like --> Entity* e = (Entity*)malloc(sizeof(Entity));
However, new also CALLS THE DEFAULT CONSTUCTOR of the class --- That's the difference 


--- Another thing new operator supports is the placement of memory --> FUTURE VIDEO


-- If using new operator, we must also use delete operator to free the memory at the end of code execution.
-- for integer --> delete b;
-- for integer array --> delete[] b;
-- for class --> delete e;

**** delete operator calls the C funtion free(), and also CALLS THE DESTRUCTOR


-- We have to call delete manually so that the allocated memory block can be freed and be listed back to the free list for further use
-- But there are strategies in C++ to automate this process -- simple strategies like scope-based pointers and advances strategies like reference counter
