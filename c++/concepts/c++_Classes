=========== The Cherno : Classes in C++ ===========

- By default, classes make everything private, so need to mention public and private data members

- Functions inside classes are called Methods

- structs are by default public, for private data member and functionalities, structs have to mention the attribute called priavte 

- C++ have structs to maintain backward-compatability with C

- So, Cherno uses structs when he wants to group a number of data
e.g. - mathematical vector class

struct Vec2
{
    float x, y;
    
    void Add(const Vec2& other)
    {
      x += other.x;
      y += other.y;
    }

};

- Cherno will never use structs for inheritence... It should always be a class
